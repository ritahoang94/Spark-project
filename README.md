# Spark-project
## Case study
This project analyses an case study and develop a system to process big data (both static and streaming). The most suitable architecture of our computer cluster for this project is based on the Hadoop and run on top with the Spark system.

## Proof of concept
### Proof of concept 1

The folder POC1 provides k-mean clustering algorithm for streaming data using Spark MLlib. When data arrives in a stream, it estimates clusters dynamically, then update them as new example.

### Proof of concept 2

The forlder POC2 provides graph processing algorithm with Spark API. The data input can be found in file test.csv.bz2
